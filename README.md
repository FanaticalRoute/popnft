# POPNFT  

<h2> Introduction </h2>

Ever imagined a tool, that would revolutionize NFT flipping? 

Well here we are, let me introduce <b>PopNFT</b>! 

This tool is a web3 tool, that would consist of giving every info on each collection you own in your wallet, for example, this tool will give the latest <i> Tweets, Airdrops Alert, Roadmap Achievements and so on...</i>

<h2>Vision for future plans</h2>

As we believe this tool is very valuable, we want to help the community by making this tool open source. 

<h2>Want to join in?</h2>

- Backend web3 developers.
- Frontend developers.
